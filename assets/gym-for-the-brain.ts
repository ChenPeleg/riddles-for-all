      "solution": "The only flies that are remaining on a table are the 10 that you killed. The others would naturally fly away when you started swatting. 101. The reason that the principle is confused is that the student has double-counted a lot of his days. So his math, while smart, is potentially incorrect in many ways. A lot of the time that he would be sleeping or relaxing occurs during the weekends and during the summer. Weekends occur during the summer and during the year, so his calculations were getting counted more times than they needed to be counted. Instead of counting them once, he was counting them several times. Another thing that he forgot is that school does not last all day. Schools in many countries only last for 6 or 8 hours per day, which means you have the rest of the day to do whatever it is that you would need to do. In that case, the 4 days that he was actually calculating for school would be 16 days or more: If his school was 6 hours per day, those 4 days would only represent 16 days of school. So the principle is confused because the student’s calculation of time was wrong.",

      "solution": "The reason that Stewart dies is that when he deduced he was about to lose, he found out that the only way he could live was to replace his poison with something that isn’t poison at all, and then he would need to drink the poison of his own before the contest. In this way, he would be drinking his weaker poison and neutralizing it with Lenny's stronger poison. So he drinks the non-poison that he submitted to the contest of the best poison maker. Once Lenny realized that this was the only way that Stewart could save himself, he figures out that he would be able to save himself by either drinking a poison that is weaker before the contest so that his poison would neutralize it during the contest itself or submit a poison that is a non-poison to the contest like Stewart did. If he were drinking the weaker poison before the contest, they would both live, and the king would realize that they were disobeying his orders; they could both either be exiled or killed. But by submitting a poison that is not a poison to the contest, Stewart would end up drinking the weaker poison before the contest and that the two non-poisons that they submitted to the contest would still make him die, but the king would be none the wiser, but he still would not get what he wanted because the two poisons were not poison at all.",

The middle child either tells the truth or lies. One day, a very rich and handsome young man comes to Adam's house and says that he wants to marry one of his daughters. Naturally, he wants to marry the oldest or the youngest so that he will always be able to tell if she is lying or telling the truth to him. Their father agrees and understands the reasoning behind his logic, but he says that he will only allow him to ask one of the girls a question, and it has to be a yes or no question. Once he does this, he can decide which one he is going to marry. Unfortunately for the handsome man, all of the daughters look the same age. What question would he ask one of the daughters at random to be able to figure out which daughter is the youngest or the oldest, so he knows which daughter tells the truth or which one lies?",

They were both very much in favor of this idea, so the doctor set the pain transfer to 10% and explained that 10% was probably more pain than the father had experienced before.

At this point, they decided to try 50% of pain transfer.

The manager at the register goes to the thrift shop next to his own and trades the 20 dollar bill for a 10 dollar bill and two 5 dollar bills. Then he gives the man his 5-dollar change. Later, the woman from the thrift shop confronts the manager and tells him that the 20-dollar bill he gave her was counterfeit. The manager agrees, and he gives the lady a different 20-dollar bill. Later that day, the manager tries to figure out how much money he lost. What did he lose?",

The criminal is fine with that, but he asks for some conditions: “All of your men must stand 10 feet away from me, and I must be able to select where each guard stands. If I survive, I get to leave.” The warden thinks about it and knows that all of his guards will still have an open shot at the criminal, so he agrees.

      "solution": "His sons are 8, and the last two are 3 years of age. The prime factorization of 72 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, so the possible ages are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18. Using that knowledge again, and these numbers, the only combinations of numbers that would be able to work for the first clue are 18, 2, and 2; 9, 4, and 2; 6, 6, and 2; 6, 4, and 3; and 8, 3, and 3. Since she doesn't know the ages after this piece of information, the sum of the three numbers must not be unique. The sum of 8, 3, and 3 and 6, 6, and 2 are the same. Now, the final clue comes in handy. Since we know that the oldest son has his own bed, it is likely that he has the bed to himself, and is older than the other two, so their ages are 8, 3, and 3 rather than 2, 6, and 6.",
