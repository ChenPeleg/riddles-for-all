At the end of the contest, each of the children came back to the palace with an enormous and beautiful plant in their hand, each expecting to be the next ruler. He looks at all the children's plants, but finally decides that a little girl who has an empty pot is going to be the next Queen of the kingdom.

However, the poison was in the ice. Tommy had finished his drink at a rapid pace, and the ice was still intact. Because the ice stayed intact, the poison wasn't released, which is why he lived.

The reason that the principle is confused is that the student has double-counted a lot of his days. So his math, while smart, is potentially incorrect in many ways. A lot of the time that he would be sleeping or relaxing occurs during the weekends and during the summer. Weekends occur during the summer and during the year, so his calculations were getting counted more times than they needed to be counted. Instead of counting them once, he was counting them several times. Another thing that he forgot is that school does not last all day. Schools in many countries only last for 6 or 8 hours per day, which means you have the rest of the day to do whatever it is that you would need to do. In that case, the 4 days that he was actually calculating for school would be 16 days or more: If his school was 6 hours per day, those 4 days would only represent 16 days of school. So the principle is confused because the student’s calculation of time was wrong.\n\n102. They all had red gloves. There were only 3 possible combinations, and we knew that they couldn't all have yellow gloves because the king had already said at least one of them had a red glove, so from there, you can start the process of elimination and learn that they would be able to identify that they all had a red glove.\n\n103. They were able to deduce that Kyle was not telling the truth because the man was stabbed in the chest. When Kyle was interviewed by the police, he had said that the man was stabbed from behind.\n\n104. The thief was Paige. Bonnie was telling the truth when she said she did not steal it, and Heather was lying, so she says the Bonnie didn't do it\n\neither to reinforce that fact. Paige was lying, so she did it. 105. On the twelfth night, she will wear blue again.\n\n106. The reason that Stewart dies is that when he deduced he was about to lose, he found out that the only way he could live was to replace his poison with something that isn’t poison at all, and then he would need to drink the poison of his own before the contest. In this way, he would be drinking his weaker poison and neutralizing it with Lenny's stronger poison. So he drinks the non-poison that he submitted to the contest of the best poison maker. Once Lenny realized that this was the only way that Stewart could save himself, he figures out that he would be able to save himself by either drinking a poison that is weaker before the contest so that his poison would neutralize it during the contest itself or submit a poison that is a non-poison to the contest like Stewart did. If he were drinking the weaker poison before the contest, they would both live, and the king would realize that they were disobeying his orders; they could both either be exiled or killed. But by submitting a poison that is not a poison to the contest, Stewart would end up drinking the weaker poison before the contest and that the two non-poisons that they submitted to the contest would still make him die, but the king would be none the wiser, but he still would not get what he wanted because the two poisons were not poison at all.\n\n107. You should choose the first door and sit in the seat. Because there is no power, when you are in the seat, it is not going to have any effect on you or your body when the other rooms would.\n\n108. The only way that you would be able to survive is to eat half of every pill. Your grandfather gave you 2 pink pills and 2 green pills. So if you split each pill in half, then it won't matter that you can't see them because half of 4 pills is 2 pills.\n\n109. I am musical notes.\n\n110. The reason that they went to the bad barbershop is that the clean cut barber with the immaculate hair has his hair styled by the unkempt\n\nstylist, and the unkempt stylist has his haircut done by the clean-cut stylist. This is made obvious as they are the only 2 barbers in town, and by that approximation, it's obvious that the dirty barber would be the barber who gives a better haircut.\n\n111. The cells that would still be open are 1,4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and, of course, the 100th cell. Only the cells that have 2 of the same factors would be open because they are opened and closed the same number of times. Because they have the same factor twice, this makes their number of factors odd.\n\n112. The police knew about the robbery because when the teller was talking to her mother, she used the mute button on the phone, so the only words her mother actually heard her say were “emergency,”“call,” and the word “help.” The teller's mother immediately called the police and told the police that there was a problem at the bank, which led the police to go to the bank to see what was wrong.\n\n113. What he should ask is the question: “Is she older than her?” and when he asks this, he should always pick the younger daughter based on what he knows. If he asked the older daughter this question, and she had said yes, then he would know who the youngest daughter is because the older daughter always tells the truth. If he asks and she says “no,” then the youngest daughter is the other one. If he had asked his questions to the younger daughter, and she says “yes,” then he already knows that she's lying, and he would pick the oldest instead. If he had asked the youngest, and she said “no,” then he would pick the other one like in the first case because you would know that she’s still lying. However, if he asked the middle daughter, it wouldn't matter because both would be acceptable choices.\n\n114. At the beginning of the story, it was said that the day was windless. In the end, it said the flag was waving back and forth. Because it was windless, the flag would have been completely still, and it wouldn't have\n\nbeen able to move. The only way it could have moved is if somebody was forcing it to move back and forth.\n\n115. The answer is that Johnny already had one cat, so when she asked him how many,he would have 7 if he was given 6, because 6 + 1 is 7. 116. He was the most powerful and then not anymore. If you read the first sentence of this riddle again, it states that he was the strongest man in the world. Saying the word “was” is past tense, which means that someone is stronger than him now, which is why he placed second and not first.\n\n117. She would need 16 apples.\n\n118. The third man. The third man understands the color of his own hat as he deduced that there is only a duo of each of the colored hats. The man placed behind him saw a duo of hats that were the same in front of his vision, then he knows that his hat must be the other color. We are able to see that because of the alternating colors, the last man only has half of the odds of getting his own right. So the last man stays silent. The third understands why the last man is silent and deduces that he cannot view a duo that matches in front of his eyes. If he could, he would speak, but he hasn't. So the third man is able to presume his own hat must be a different color than the one in front of him, and his presumption is correct in this case. Under that same logic, after the third man tells the color of his hat, the second man, even though he only sees the wall, would be able to go free next because he knows his hat would be the opposite of whatever color the third man's hat was.\n\n119. The prisoners would have to choose a leader, and then everyone else would need to be a follower. If you are a follower, then you would need to make sure that switch A is in the on position and toggle switch B. Then you would not have been able to toggle switch A, and you would have been able to see the switch on during a previous visit. Then, you should toggle switch A. Instead, you would toggle switch B if you were the leader.Then you would need to turn switch A on. If it was off, turn\n\nswitch A on. If it was on, and you did not turn on switch A during the previous visit, then you would need to increment the count of prisoners. Once the leader had incremented the count to 23, they would be able to yell that every prisoner has been here. Then all of them would be released because they would be correct.\n\n120. You would walk to the left and drink the fourth and the third. There would be no point in going to the right, because there are only 2 test tubes on the right, and the iguana poison is going to override the antidote to the other poison. The cow is number 2, which means that the iguana is either in number one or number 4. If the cow is number 2, then that would mean that the lizard is number 1, 2, or 3. Since we have been able to deduce that the iguana is either 1 or 4, the iguana and the lizard cannot be beside each other, and we know that the cow is number 2. That makes it impossible for the iguana’s saliva to be 3 or 4. Using what we know, now that we understand the iguana’s number,we drink 3 and 4 because the lizard would be in either 3 or 4, and you would be safe from the poison.\n\n121. One would allow a single person to flip the bulb off. The rest would turn it on if they had never turned it on before. If they have turned it on before, then, they will do nothing. The prisoner who can turn it off then knows that they have all been there, and he could save them all when he turns it off 99 times.\n\n122. The pain was transferred to the man who sired the infant. The mother had been unfaithful with the mailman. It was the mailman's baby. It never mentions that the husband is the baby's father, but because the mailman is dead on the porch, we can deduce that he was the baby’s father and that the pain killed him.\n\n123. The German\n\n124. Brandon brings his sleeping bag home when he realizes he forgot his flashlight. He leaves his sleeping bag at home. He realized he did not bring his tent; Brandon then goes home with his flashlight. Instead of picking up his tent, he sees his sleeping bag and takes that instead, leaving\n\nhis tent and flashlight at home. He goes back when he gets to camp because he now needs his flashlight and tent. Brandon brings his sleeping bag,and when he gets his tent and flashlight, he leaves his sleeping bag. Every time he brings something to the campsite, he leaves what he had at home.\n\n125. Before they entered the bar, the gentleman with the baseball cap told the cowboy, \"If I can spray beer everywhere in the bar and make the bartender laugh, you have to give me five thousand dollars.\"\n\n126. Mike can figure it out. If Josh saw that Mike and Brad had their hats are in the same color, he would know his hat color. Since he doesn't quickly figure out his hat color, Mike knows that his hat and Brad’s don't have the same hat color. So all he has to do is say that his hat color is the opposite of Brad's hat color (after giving enough time to be sure that Josh doesn't know his own color).\n\n127. I am a bad conductor.\n\n128. Imagine thatonly one resident lives on the island. He will look to see that there are no green-eyed residents, and once this happens, he would realize that he knows his eye color. If there are 2, they will see that there is one person with one color, and if the person did not leave,it means that they would have the same eye color. The same logic is true for the other person’s viewpoint. With this knowledge, the green-eyed people would be able to leave in a certain number of days because each resident will need an additional day to know what color they have. 129. Water, earth, air, fire, and spirit.\n\n130. He lost $5. The woman from the thrift shop gave him $20 in change but eventually got $20 back. She broke even. The guy who spent 15 dollars gave the manager nothing (except counterfeit money) but got $5 back from the manager. So the manager lost only $5 and gave free products.\n\n131. The woman didn’t look at the entrance. She knew her husband wouldn’t come in.\n\n132. The individual with the canine photo. The other duo had voted the other’s post down and their own up. The canine photo owner voted each person’s up.\n\n133. The criminal set up all the guards so that each person is directly across the other. If they fired, they would possibly shoot the other guards so they couldn’t shoot at all.\n\n134. The hat is orange. If Jack doesn't know the color of his hat, then the other two men's hats cannot both be red; otherwise, he would know that his hat is orange. When James doesn't know his hat color either, that means Jim's hat could not be red; otherwise, Jack would have to know his hat was orange to fulfill the information discovered through Jack's answer.\n\n135. They figured out that they needed 5 people to make the plan work.One person is in each corner, and one person needs to be moving at all times from one to the other.This means there is someone else in the building already.\n\n136. One answer is the following. Ask the second man, “If I were going to ask if you are Random, would you say ‘ja’?” If 2 answers “ja”, either 2 is Random (and is answering randomly), or 2 is not Random, and the answer indicates that 1 is indeed Random. Either way, 3 is not Random. If 2 answers “da”, either 2 is Random (and is answering randomly), or 2 is not Random, and the answer indicates that 1 is not Random. Either way, you know the identity of a guy who is not Random. Q2: Go to the guy who was identified as not being Random by the previous question (either 1 or 2), and ask him, “If I asked you ‘Are you False?’, would you say ‘ja’?” Since he is not Random, an answer of “da” indicates that he is True, and an answer of “ja” indicates that he is False. Q3: Ask the same guy the question: “If I asked you, ‘Is 2 Random?’, would you say ‘ja’?” If the answer is “ja”, 2 is Random; if the answer is da, the guy you have not yet spoken to is Random. The remaining guy can be identified by elimination.\n\n137. It could be any word as long as it contained a quintet of letters. In each of the examples, the guard had said something, and then the person responded with something different. But the word they said had a single letter more than the word that the guard had said first.\n\n138. Each of the husbands who are unfaithful will be murdered, and it will take one less night than the number of cheating husbands for their wives to discover this. If one man was cheating, and that woman hadn't have heard of any other infidelity, she would know it was her husband who was cheating. If two husbands are cheating, both of their wives would think that since they have only heard of one man cheating, he should die the next morning. If he doesn't die, she knows her husband must also be cheating, and that's the reason the other husband didn't die. Following this logic, you know that all of the men will die after one less night than there are cheating men.\n\n139. The black criminal will yell \"black\" if there is an uneven number of black shirts in front of him and \"white\" if there is an even number of black shirts in front of him. The next criminal will then count the number of black shirts in front of him, and if it was odd and is now even, or vice versa, then that person knows what color their shirt is. The next person then knows their shirt color based on what the people before them said and how many black shirts are in front of them. In this way, the front 99 criminals will know their shirt color and will be set free. The criminal in the back who goes first has a 50 percent chance of being set free.\n\n140. He sang the song “Happy Birthday” because any name can be put into it. The rich woman honored the deal, so he went home rich. 141. His horse was named “Friday”.\n\n142. It's an electric train; there's no smoke.\n\n143. The letter M\n\n144. A heart\n\n145. A gymnast\n\n146. A keyboard for a computer\n\n147. Chocolate\n\n148. An ant\n\n149. The alphabet\n\n150. First, Jack and Jason will cross the wire (in a duo of minutes). Then Jack brings the flashlight back (1 minute). Next, Alex and Cindy will cross (10 minutes). Then Jason will bring the flashlight back (2 minutes). And finally, Jason and Jack will cross (2 minutes). 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\n151. His sons are 8, and the last two are 3 years of age. The prime factorization of 72 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, so the possible ages are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18. Using that knowledge again, and these numbers, the only combinations of numbers that would be able to work for the first clue are 18, 2, and 2; 9, 4, and 2; 6, 6, and 2; 6, 4, and 3; and 8, 3, and 3. Since she doesn't know the ages after this piece of information, the sum of the three numbers must not be unique. The sum of 8, 3, and 3 and 6, 6, and 2 are the same. Now, the final clue comes in handy. Since we know that the oldest son has his own bed, it is likely that he has the bed to himself, and is older than the other two, so their ages are 8, 3, and 3 rather than 2, 6, and 6.\n\n152.

The smart daughter had purchased a box that contained matches and a candle. After making sure that the candle was lit properly, the light from the candle filled the room entirely.\n\n217. They should have them shoot it again. There is a 2/6 chance they will get shot if it’s spun again. There are four possible spots that don't have bullets, and only one is followed by a bullet. This means that if they don't spin it, there is a 1/4 chance that they will be shot.\n\n218. The duck can travel a quarter of the journey to land before swimming in a circular path around the center of the lake (the duck will be moving slightly faster around than the dog in their circles). Once the duck is as far as he can get away from the dog in his circle, he can swim the remaining 3/4 of the way to shore. The dog must travel the radius of the lake times Pi (radius * π) while the duck only has to travel 3/4 the radius four times slower (3/4 * radius * 4). So the duck will be able to make it to the shore and fly before the dog reaches it.\n\n219. Parent 1: Who would give that so much junk food to a child that was unable to speak and who was small?
