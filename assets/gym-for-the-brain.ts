The student angrily replies that there isn't enough time for him to attend because he needs a certain length of sleep every day, and he calculates that he would need 122 days of sleep. After calculating, weekends count for over 100 days in the year and summer vacation is 2 months. He also declares that if he spent an hour on each meal, that would accumulate to 45 days in a year. He further calculates that he would need at least 2 hours to relax and to do whatever he wanted to do in a day, which adds another month to his schedule. He then says that if you add all of that, it would only leave him 4 days for school. The principal is confused and rightly so, but he is unable to figure out why. What is wrong with the student's argument to confuse the principal?",
      "solution": "101. The reason that the principle is confused is that the student has double-counted a lot of his days. So his math, while smart, is potentially incorrect in many ways. A lot of the time that he would be sleeping or relaxing occurs during the weekends and during the summer. Weekends occur during the summer and during the year, so his calculations were getting counted more times than they needed to be counted. Instead of counting them once, he was counting them several times. Another thing that he forgot is that school does not last all day. Schools in many countries only last for 6 or 8 hours per day, which means you have the rest of the day to do whatever it is that you would need to do. In that case, the 4 days that he was actually calculating for school would be 16 days or more: If his school was 6 hours per day, those 4 days would only represent 16 days of school. So the principle is confused because the student’s calculation of time was wrong.",

There were only 3 possible combinations, and we knew that they couldn't all have yellow gloves because the king had already said at least one of them had a red glove, so from there, you can start the process of elimination and learn that they would be able to identify that they all had a red glove.",

There is a kingdom with poison, and everyone knows that the only way that you can cure yourself is to drink an even stronger poison to neutralize the poison that you've already drunk. The king doesn't want to die and wishes to make the strongest poison possible so that, anytime he gets poisoned, the poison that he takes will neutralize any other poison that he has been given. In order to make sure that this can happen correctly, he ordered two chemists to come to his kingdom. They are the best chemists in the land, and have proven their value. Their names are: Stewart and Lenny. The king is going to have them both create a poison as strong as they can make it, and after they've completed their poison, he will then have others to drink them and then their own. Whoever dies has created the weaker poison. Stewart knows that Lenny is much better at making poison than he is, so he knows that he is more likely to die. Using this knowledge, Stewart makes a plan to ensure that he will live, but that Lenny will die. On the day of the contest, Lenny realizes that Stewart knew that he had no chance of beating him, so Lenny quickly thinks of a plan that will ensure that he will live, and Stewart will die instead. In the end, Lenny is the one who lives, while Stewart is the one who dies. The king is left unhappy because he didn't get what he wanted. What happened?",
      "solution": "106. The reason that Stewart dies is that when he deduced he was about to lose, he found out that the only way he could live was to replace his poison with something that isn’t poison at all, and then he would need to drink the poison of his own before the contest. In this way, he would be drinking his weaker poison and neutralizing it with Lenny's stronger poison. So he drinks the non-poison that he submitted to the contest of the best poison maker. Once Lenny realized that this was the only way that Stewart could save himself, he figures out that he would be able to save himself by either drinking a poison that is weaker before the contest so that his poison would neutralize it during the contest itself or submit a poison that is a non-poison to the contest like Stewart did. If he were drinking the weaker poison before the contest, they would both live, and the king would realize that they were disobeying his orders; they could both either be exiled or killed. But by submitting a poison that is not a poison to the contest, Stewart would end up drinking the weaker poison before the contest and that the two non-poisons that they submitted to the contest would still make him die, but the king would be none the wiser, but he still would not get what he wanted because the two poisons were not poison at all.",

      "text": "116. Ben was the most powerful man on the globe, and he had the skill to lift something that weighed 1,000 kg easily. He even boasted that he was able to pick up 5 women at once without feeling a single ounce of pain. One day, there was a weightlifting show that was well known, so the top 5 strongest men entered, including Ben. The challenge was that they were going to have to lift up an extremely heavy object of 1,005 kg for 5 minutes. Whoever didn't drop it until the target time would be the winner. If everyone did it, the judges would decide to give first place to the person who lifted it the most easily and stood still without any trouble at all. If Ben was the strongest, then he would have come out first, but instead, when the challenge was over, he placed second. Why did he place second and not first?",
      "solution": "116. He was the most powerful and then not anymore. If you read the first sentence of this riddle again, it states that he was the strongest man in the world. Saying the word “was” is past tense, which means that someone is stronger than him now, which is why he placed second and not first.",

The doctor told her that she would need to eat a single apple in order to cure her aunt. In the village where they were staying, no one had any apples, so she tried another village. When she got there, she realized that they had millions of apples in a garden, but when she tried to get in, the gatekeeper told her that all the apples that she brings out of the garden should be shared between them. So how many apples did the woman come out with from the garden to share with the gatekeeper while keeping an apple to cure her aunt?",

      "text": "118. There were 4 men who walked to a desert. All 4 men are knocked out at the same time, and when they awaken, their bodies are buried in the sand. They cannot look anywhere but straight ahead of them. They were positioned in a way that each man can see another man's head before them. However, between the first and second man, there's a wall. Because of this, the only thing the first man can see is the desert, and the only thing the second man can see is the wall. The third man sees the second man's head and the wall, and the fourth man sees 2 heads and the wall. On top of each man's head is a hat; the underside of each hat is pink, but the outside of each hat is either of green or red. Before any of the men can speak, their kidnappers have told them that if they speak, they will die. If one of them can guess the color of their hat on the first try, then they get to live, and they can go free. The kidnappers have told them that there are 2 green hats and 2 red hats. Because we are smart, and we can observe the situation, we can deduce that the order of the hats is green then red and green then red again. We know the perspective that each man has and that they can only see the desert, the wall, or the color of the cap in front of them. Out of the 4 men, who knows for sure the color of his own hat, and more importantly, why does he know the color of his own hat?",
      "solution": "118. The third man. The third man understands the color of his own hat as he deduced that there is only a duo of each of the colored hats. The man placed behind him saw a duo of hats that were the same in front of his vision, then he knows that his hat must be the other color. We are able to see that because of the alternating colors, the last man only has half of the odds of getting his own right. So the last man stays silent. The third understands why the last man is silent and deduces that he cannot view a duo that matches in front of his eyes. If he could, he would speak, but he hasn't. So the third man is able to presume his own hat must be a different color than the one in front of him, and his presumption is correct in this case. Under that same logic, after the third man tells the color of his hat, the second man, even though he only sees the wall, would be able to go free next because he knows his hat would be the opposite of whatever color the third man's hat was.",

      "solution": "120. You would walk to the left and drink the fourth and the third. There would be no point in going to the right, because there are only 2 test tubes on the right, and the iguana poison is going to override the antidote to the other poison. The cow is number 2, which means that the iguana is either in number one or number 4. If the cow is number 2, then that would mean that the lizard is number 1, 2, or 3. Since we have been able to deduce that the iguana is either 1 or 4, the iguana and the lizard cannot be beside each other, and we know that the cow is number 2. That makes it impossible for the iguana’s saliva to be 3 or 4. Using what we know, now that we understand the iguana’s number,we drink 3 and 4 because the lizard would be in either 3 or 4, and you would be safe from the poison.",

When they arrive, the doctor says that he invented the new machine that could transfer part of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He then asked the couple if they're willing to try it. They were both very much in favor of this idea, so the doctor set the pain transfer to 10% and explained that 10% was probably more pain than the father had experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to make it higher. The doctor adjusted the machine to 10% higher, and the husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure; he was amazed to see that he was doing amazingly well. At this point, they decided to try 50% of pain transfer. The husband continued to feel fine, and since the pain transfer was obviously helping the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer every single ounce of pain to him instead of his wife. The wife delivered a healthy baby with no pain, and she and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, they saw that their mailman was dead on the porch. Why did the mailman die instead of her husband?",

Your task is to determine the identities of 1, 2, and 3 by asking three yes or no questions—each question must be put to exactly one guy. The guys understand English but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for “yes” and “no” are “da” and “ja”, in some order. You do not know which word means which. What three questions can you ask?",
      "solution": "136. One answer is the following. Ask the second man, “If I were going to ask if you are Random, would you say ‘ja’?” If 2 answers “ja”, either 2 is Random (and is answering randomly), or 2 is not Random, and the answer indicates that 1 is indeed Random. Either way, 3 is not Random. If 2 answers “da”, either 2 is Random (and is answering randomly), or 2 is not Random, and the answer indicates that 1 is not Random. Either way, you know the identity of a guy who is not Random. Q2: Go to the guy who was identified as not being Random by the previous question (either 1 or 2), and ask him, “If I asked you ‘Are you False?’, would you say ‘ja’?” Since he is not Random, an answer of “da” indicates that he is True, and an answer of “ja” indicates that he is False. Q3: Ask the same guy the question: “If I asked you, ‘Is 2 Random?’, would you say ‘ja’?” If the answer is “ja”, 2 is Random; if the answer is da, the guy you have not yet spoken to is Random. The remaining guy can be identified by elimination.",

On the day of the party, a man who wasn't invited wanted to get into the party, so he paid attention to what the people with the passwords were saying. Guard: “Pig” Person: “Farm” *next person* Guard: “Bear” Person: “Woods” *next person* Guard: “Frog” Person: “Water.” The intruder thought he had the password, so when the guard said “Bird,” the Intruder said “Tree.” He was thrown out of the party. Why?What could have he used for the password?",
      "solution": "137. It could be any word as long as it contained a quintet of letters. In each of the examples, the guard had said something, and then the person responded with something different. But the word they said had a single letter more than the word that the guard had said first.",

When one of the husbands cheats on his wife with one of the other wives, his wife has no idea.With a large amount of gossip in the complex, all of the other wives know he is cheating. If a wife finds out that her husband is cheating on her, she kills him the following morning. Someone anonymously sends an email to all of the wives in the building, saying that at least 1 man is cheating on his wife in the building. How many husbands will be killed, and how long will it take?",
      "solution": "138. Each of the husbands who are unfaithful will be murdered, and it will take one less night than the number of cheating husbands for their wives to discover this. If one man was cheating, and that woman hadn't have heard of any other infidelity, she would know it was her husband who was cheating. If two husbands are cheating, both of their wives would think that since they have only heard of one man cheating, he should die the next morning. If he doesn't die, she knows her husband must also be cheating, and that's the reason the other husband didn't die. Following this logic, you know that all of the men will die after one less night than there are cheating men.",

The next criminal will then count the number of black shirts in front of him, and if it was odd and is now even, or vice versa, then that person knows what color their shirt is. The next person then knows their shirt color based on what the people before them said and how many black shirts are in front of them. In this way, the front 99 criminals will know their shirt color and will be set free. The criminal in the back who goes first has a 50 percent chance of being set free.",

The physicist says, \"I have three sons, and the product of their ages is 72.\" The woman tells the physicist that she needs more information, so the physicist tells her, \"The sum of their ages is equal to our house number.\" The woman still needs more information, so the physicist tells her, “My oldest son has his own bed, and the other two share bunk beds.” How old are his sons?",
      "solution": "151. His sons are 8, and the last two are 3 years of age. The prime factorization of 72 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, so the possible ages are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18. Using that knowledge again, and these numbers, the only combinations of numbers that would be able to work for the first clue are 18, 2, and 2; 9, 4, and 2; 6, 6, and 2; 6, 4, and 3; and 8, 3, and 3. Since she doesn't know the ages after this piece of information, the sum of the three numbers must not be unique. The sum of 8, 3, and 3 and 6, 6, and 2 are the same. Now, the final clue comes in handy. Since we know that the oldest son has his own bed, it is likely that he has the bed to himself, and is older than the other two, so their ages are 8, 3, and 3 rather than 2, 6, and 6.",

There are four possible spots that don't have bullets, and only one is followed by a bullet. This means that if they don't spin it, there is a 1/4 chance that they will be shot.",

Within the parameter of the lake, there is a hunting dog that desperately wants the duck, but cannot swim. So the duck must make it to the land before taking off, and must do so before the dog makes it to him. The dog is almost 4 times faster than the duck, and always runs to the point around the lake closest to the duck. How can the duck get out of the lake and take flight before the dog gets him?",
      "solution": "218. The duck can travel a quarter of the journey to land before swimming in a circular path around the center of the lake (the duck will be moving slightly faster around than the dog in their circles). Once the duck is as far as he can get away from the dog in his circle, he can swim the remaining 3/4 of the way to shore. The dog must travel the radius of the lake times Pi (radius * π) while the duck only has to travel 3/4 the radius four times slower (3/4 * radius * 4). So the duck will be able to make it to the shore and fly before the dog reaches it.",
