Again, he gave her the same answer, and again, she asked him the same question. He replies, “6.” Happy that he seemed to understand what was going on, she asks him one more time that if she gave him 2 cats, and then 2 more and 2 more, how many would he have? Thinking for a second, he replied again, “7” and seemed upset that the teacher couldn't understand where his math was coming from. Johnny is not wrong, and his teacher is wrong, but why? 
116. Ben was the most powerful man on the globe, and he had the skill to lift something that weighed 1,000 kg easily. He even boasted that he was able to pick up 5 women at once without feeling a single ounce of pain. One day, there was a weightlifting show that was well known, so the top 5 strongest men entered, including Ben. The challenge was that they were going to have to lift up an extremely heavy object of 1,005 kg for 5 minutes. Whoever didn't drop it until the target time would be the winner. If everyone did it, the judges would decide to give first place to the person who lifted it the most easily and stood still without any trouble at all. If Ben was the strongest, then he would have come out first, but instead, when the challenge was over, he placed second. Why did he place second and not first? 
117. There was a woman who wanted to treat her aunt from an illness, so they went to the doctor. The doctor told her that she would need to eat a single apple in order to cure her aunt.

When she got there, she realized that they had millions of apples in a garden, but when she tried to get in, the gatekeeper told her that all the apples that she brings out of the garden should be shared between them. So how many apples did the woman come out with from the garden to share with the gatekeeper while keeping an apple to cure her aunt? 
118. There were 4 men who walked to a desert. All 4 men are knocked out at the same time, and when they awaken, their bodies are buried in the sand. They cannot look anywhere but straight ahead of them. They were positioned in a way that each man can see another man's head before them. However, between the first and second man, there's a wall. Because of this, the only thing the first man can see is the desert, and the only thing the second man can see is the wall. The third man sees the second man's head and the wall, and the fourth man sees 2 heads and the wall. On top of each man's head is a hat; the underside of each hat is pink, but the outside of each hat is either of green or red. Before any of the men can speak, their kidnappers have told them that if they speak, they will die. If one of them can guess the color of their hat on the first try, then they get to live, and they can go free. The kidnappers have told them that there are 2 green hats and 2 red hats. Because we are smart, and we can observe the situation, we can deduce that the order of the hats is green then red and green then red again. We know the perspective that each man has and that they can only see the desert, the wall, or the color of the cap in front of them. Out of the 4 men, who knows for sure the color of his own hat, and more importantly, why does he know the color of his own hat? 
119. A prison has 23 prisoners and 23 cells, so each prisoner is alone in their cell. The prisoners have no way to communicate with each other in any way. There is another room, though. They have a rec room. The rec room has 2 switches on the wall: An A switch and a B switch. The switches have both on and off positions, but they start in an unknown position. The prisoners are randomly taken to and from the rec room one at a time, and they must change the position of only one of the 2 switches every time they go into that room. At any point, a prisoner can yell out that every prisoner has been here. If the prisoner is correct that all of the prisoners have visited that room, they can all go free. If they were wrong, then they are all executed instead. Before they start, they are given one session to plan, during which they can discuss a method to understand how to win the game. What method could they use to make sure that they all go free instead of being executed? 
120. You have been kidnapped and poisoned by a scientist who is pure evil. He has told you that the only antidote is the saliva of a lizard. He has the saliva of 6 different animals: An iguana, a lizard, a koala, a lemur, a giraffe, and a cow. He hasn't labeled the test tubes, so you have no way of knowing who is and what is what. On the left is a table where 4 of the test tubes are residing, and on the right, 2 test tubes are residing. The lizard saliva is what can save you, and the iguana is poisonous. The test tubes of the lizard and the iguana are on the same table. The table that has tubes on the left are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 
4. The lizard saliva will not override the iguana poison. The poison and the lizard saliva are not right beside each other. You don't know where the cow test tube is, but you know that the cow is in either number 2 or number 
3. You know that the iguana test tube is not to the right of the cow. You only have time to drink 2 test tubes, so which side do you run toward, and which test tubes do you drink? 
121. There is a cell of 100 prisoners, and each prisoner is kept out of contact with the others. In one area of the prison, there is a single light bulb. Every day, the warden picks a prisoner at random; it doesn't matter if they have been picked before. If he picks you, you will be taken to the lobby. The prisoner then has the choice to flip on the switch if they choose to do so. The light bulb will go off. When the prisoner is taken into the area with the lightbulb, he has the option of saying that every prisoner has been brought to the light bulb. If it's true, the prisoners go free, but if it's false, the prisoners die. A prisoner should only say this if he knows 100% that it's true. Before the first day of the process, all of the prisoners are allowed to get together to discuss a strategy that could possibly save themselves. What strategy should they use about the light bulb to ensure that they will go free? 
122. A husband and wife are in the emergency room because the wife is in labor. When they arrive, the doctor says that he invented the new machine that could transfer part of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He then asked the couple if they're willing to try it. They were both very much in favor of this idea, so the doctor set the pain transfer to 10% and explained that 10% was probably more pain than the father had experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to make it higher. The doctor adjusted the machine to 10% higher, and the husband was still feeling fine.The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure; he was amazed to see that he was doing amazingly well. At this point, they decided to try 50% of pain transfer. The husband continued to feel fine, and since the pain transfer was obviously helping the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer every single ounce of pain to him instead of his wife. The wife delivered a healthy baby with no pain, and she and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, they saw that their mailman was dead on the porch. Why did the mailman die instead of her husband? 
123. There isa quintet of homes that were painted in a quintet of different colors. In each dwelling lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 people also drink a certain type of beverage, and they smoke a particular brand of cigar. They all have a particular pet, and none of them have the same pet. None of them smoke the same brand of the cigars, and none of them drink the same beverage. If the man living in the center house drinks milk, while the green homeowner drinks coffee, and the greenhouse is on the left of the white house, we can use these clues to determine who lives where. The British native lives in a red house, and the Dane drinks tea. The German only smokes Prince cigars, and the person who has Norwegian nationality lives next door to the blue house. The Norwegian lives in the first house and the owner of the yellow house only smokes Dunhill cigars. The Swede only keeps dogs as pets, and the man who only smokes Blend cigars has a neighbor who only drinks water. The owner of the house who only drinks beer smokes Blue master cigars. The person who smokes Pall Mall cigars only has birds, and the person who smokes the Blend cigars lives next to the owner who keeps the cats. The man who keeps the horse lives next to the man who smokes the Dunhill cigars. Keeping all of this in mind, who owns the fish?
