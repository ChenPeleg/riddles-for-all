# Phase 4: Data Storage ❌

## Step 8: Implement storage solution ❌

- ❌ Use JSON file storage (for frontend compatibility)
- ❌ Create JSON structure/schema for riddle data
- ❌ Build data access utilities for reading/writing JSON files
- ❌ Consider splitting into multiple JSON files if dataset is large (e.g., by category or source)

## Step 9: Populate storage ❌

- ❌ Import all parsed riddles into storage
- ❌ Add indexes for search optimization (if using structured JSON with metadata)
- ❌ Validate data integrity
