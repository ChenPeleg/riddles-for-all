# Phase 6: User Interface

## Step 12: Build CLI interface

- Create command-line commands (search, list, view, stats)
- Add interactive search mode
- Implement result display formatting

## Step 13: Optional: Web interface

- Set up simple web server (Express.js)
- Create search form and results page
- Add basic styling

**Note**: This is optional since the future goal is a frontend-only website. The CLI is primarily for testing and data management during development.
